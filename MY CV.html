		<div>
		<p> 
		<strong>Lt EN Eyina</strong> a 27-year-old individual with a passion for technology and education, holding a 1<sup>st</sup> degree in Computer Science Education and 2<sup>nd</sup> degree in Computer Science. Currently, I am channeling my expertise and enthusiasm into the field of education as an instructor at the prestigious Nigerian Army Institute of Science Education and Technology (NAISET).</p>

		<p>My journey in the realm of computer science has equipped me with a strong foundation in both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. I am driven by a curiosity to explore the ever-evolving landscape of technology and its applications in solving real-world problems. The dynamic nature of the field has instilled in me a mindset of continuous learning and adaptation.</p>

		<p>In my role as an instructor at the NAISET, I am committed to imparting knowledge and skills to the next generation of learners. Teaching is not just a profession for me; it's a fulfilling opportunity to contribute to the growth and development of individuals who will shape the future. I strive to create an engaging and supportive learning environment where students can thrive and discover their potential.</p>

		<p><em>Beyond the classroom</em>, I actively seek opportunities to stay updated with the latest advancements in technology. Whether it's attending conferences, participating in workshops, or collaborating with fellow professionals, I believe in the power of staying connected to the broader community to enhance my own knowledge and, consequently, enrich the learning experience I provide to my students.</p>

		<p>In addition to my professional pursuits, I find joy in cultivating a balanced lifestyle. Outside of work, you might find me exploring new coding projects, reading about emerging technologies, or enjoying outdoor activities that help me recharge and maintain a healthy work-life balance.</p>

		<p >As I continue to grow both personally and professionally, I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. My dedication to education, coupled with my technical background, positions me to contribute meaningfully to the intersection of technology and learning. I look forward to the challenges and opportunities that will shape my journey in the years to come.</p>
