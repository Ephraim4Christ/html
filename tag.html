<u><h1>REASON FOR THE SPREAD OF ISLAM IN WEST AFRICA</h1></u>
The following are the reasons for the spread Islam in West Africa. By the end of the fifteenth century, Islam had spread southwards to the fringes of the forest belt.
<u><h2>THE NATURE OF ISLAM</h2></u>
The nature of Islam as a religion accepting polygamy to some extent, its tolerance of traditional African religions, its simplicity of doctrine and mode of worship helped propagators to make converts in Africa. 	
<u><h2>TRADE</h2></u>
<div><p>Another major reason that led to the rapid spread of Islam in West Africa was the trans-Saharan trade network. <p>From the seventh century onwards, Muslim traders from the Maghreb and the Sahara started settling first in some of the market centres in the Sahel and then in the Savanna areas.</p> Al-Bakri, a renowned Arabic Scholar and merchant wrote in 1067, that the capital of ancient Ghana was already divided into two parts; about six miles apart, the Muslim traders’ part which had as many as twelve mosques and the King’s part had one mosque for the use of the king’s Muslim visitors.</p> It was these resident Muslim traders who converted the rulers and the principal local town’s people to Islam. Also, according to Kano Chronicles, during the reign of Yaji, the King of Kano from 1349 to 1385, the Wangarawa came from Melle bringing the Mohammedan religion. <p>These examples grew the process of Islamisation or conversion to Islam, as it gathered momentum.</p></div>
<u><h2>ACTIVITIES OF MUSLIM CLERICS</u></h2>
Islam also spread into West Africa through the activities of Muslim clerics, marabouts and scholars or mallams. These clerics or learned men founded their own religious centres which attracted students from all parts of the Western Sudan
